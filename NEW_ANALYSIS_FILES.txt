═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

KEY FINDING:

Your 404 errors are caused by a FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE MISMATCH:
  ▪ App built for: Node.js server (output: 'standalone')
  ▪ Deployed to: Azure Static Web Apps (static files only)
  ▪ Result: 95% of app's functionality broken

This cannot be fixed with configuration tweaks.
The hosting platform must change.

RECOMMENDATION: Migrate to Azure App Service
  ▪ Timeline: 30 minutes
  ▪ Cost: $50-70/month
  ▪ Effort: Minimal (no code changes)
  ▪ Result: All features work
